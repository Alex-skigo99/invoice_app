### A few words about using Jest.spyOn
During the development of the current project, I encountered unpredictable behavior of spyON - a very useful feature of the Jest library. Jest is a popular tool for testing Javascript code. And the spyOn function allows us to monitor the behavior of any function used in the code under test, such as: was it called during testing? how many times? set an output value, etc. What's the problem? I am showing an example that is simpler than my case, but it is pretty clear.

Let's have the following logic for creating an instance:

```
export function setRandomCode() {
    const letters = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
    const randomLetter = letters.charAt(Math.floor(Math.random() * 26));
    const randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10);
    return randomLetter + randomNumber;
};

export const getInstanceWithRandomCode_1 = (instance: {}) => {
    return { ...instance, code: setRandomCode() };
};
```

I want to create an integration test in which I need to change a random code to a certain value. Let it be "A1". For this task, I use Jest.spyOn.mockReturnValue("A1") and check if the "spy" function was called:

```
import * as jestSpyOn from './jest_spyon';
import { getInstanceWithRandomCode_1 } from './jest_spyon';

describe('jest.spyOn', () => {
    it('should return a random code', () => {
        const spy = jest.spyOn(jestSpyOn, 'setRandomCode');
        spy.mockReturnValue('A1');
        console.log(getInstanceWithRandomCode_1({}));
        expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalled();
        spy.mockRestore();
    })
});
```

... and the test fails. Why? What's going on? There are no syntax or logic errors. After hours of reading documentation, watching YouTube, and playing around with the code, I found a way to fix this buggy behavior that had me stumped. I converted my "spy" function into a method

```
export const randomCode = {
    set() {
        const letters = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
        const randomLetter = letters.charAt(Math.floor(Math.random() * 26));
        const randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10);
        return randomLetter + randomNumber;
    }
};

export const getInstanceWithRandomCode_2 = (instance: {}) => {
    return { ...instance, code: randomCode.set() };
};
```

... and my test

```
import { randomCode } from './jest_spyon';
import { getInstanceWithRandomCode_2 } from './jest_spyon';

describe('jest.spyOn', () => {
    it('should return a random code', () => {
        const spy = jest.spyOn(randomCode, 'set');
        spy.mockReturnValue('A1');
        console.log(getInstanceWithRandomCode_2({}));
        expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalled();
        spy.mockRestore();
    });
});
```

...passed. Great!
